[{"nr":1,"name":"General","topic":"Subject matter and objectives","desc_en":"Article 1 states what the purpose of the law is. The two mein themes of the EU Data Privacy law is the protection of the fundamental right to privacy, but also the free flow of data across EU members states. The economy should not be bothered by different levels of data privacy and regulations that would not allow a free flow of data."},
{"nr":2,"name":"General","topic":"Material scope","desc_en":"Article 2 defines the subject matter that is regulated by the law. For this regulation it explains that only processing of personal data falls under the law. But there are also some exceptions that are not covered by the law like processing data for criminal prosecution or ‘data processing’ on your personal computer."},
{"nr":3,"name":"General","topic":"Territorial scope","desc_en":"Article 3 defines the territorial application of the law. The EU Commission wants this law to cover all EU-companies as well as foreign companies operating on EU market. It therefore applies to a Chinese citizen, if his data is processed by a EU company, as well as an US company, if it offers services on the EU market and collects data of EU citizens."},
{"nr":4,"name":"General","topic":"Definitions","desc_en":"Definitions sound boring, but they are pretty important. In Article 4 defines what ‘data’ or what is a ‘consent’ is. Every time this law is referring to ‘data’, it only refers to data that is included in this definition. There are many amendments aiming to change these definitions and therefore the scope of the whole law. For example: If there is a very limited definition of ‚data‘, the law will apply to almost nothing. But if there is a very broad definition too many things would be covered."},
{"nr":5,"name":"Principles","topic":"Principles relating to personal data processing","desc_en":"Article 5 is a core element of this regulation. It defines how data should be used. Therese are the basic principles that everybody has to stick to. It is e.g. mandatory to delete data, if it is not necessary to hold it anymore. Or there is the principle of purpose based processing: If you are giving certain information to a physician, then you want him to only use such information for your treatment and billing. But you would be outraged if he would use them to send you advertisements of pharmaceutical companies. How well your right to data privacy is protected depends very much these basic principles and possible exceptions form these principles."},
{"nr":6,"name":"Principles","topic":"Lawfulness of processing","desc_en":"In data privacy laws are in general prohibiting the use of data. Companied can only process data if they have a justification to do so. Justifications like ‘consent’ by the user are listed in Article 6. The more justifications allow the processing of data, the easier it gets to collect and use your personal data. At the same time the regulations should be practical. If you are only allowed to process data after giving ‘consent’, we would spend all clicking on buttons to give our consent. Things like video surveillance in a bank would not be possible, because you can’t get the consent of every single customer. So there must be other justifications as well, but how many?"},
{"nr":7,"name":"Principles","topic":"Conditions for consent","desc_en":"Data can always be processed if the user agrees to it. But what is a valid ‘consent’? Can you hide some vague wording under 25 pages of terms and conditions? Can I withdraw my consent at any time? Those things are regulated in article 7."},
{"nr":8,"name":"Principles","topic":"Processing of personal data of a child","desc_en":"There are even companies using data on children for dishonest things. At the same time a school, a hospital or a summer camp has to be able to use the data of a child. Article 8 enacts particularly protections for data of children."},
{"nr":9,"name":"Principles","topic":"Processing of special categories of personal data","desc_en":"Certain types of data have always been seen as especially confidential. Health information, political attitude, sexual orientation or criminal records can harm people more than general data. Therefore article 9 (in parallel to article 6) is enacting stricter rules when using such data."},
{"nr":10,"name":"Principles","topic":"Processing not allowing identification","desc_en":"You have to process even more data to comply with a law? No, says article 10."},
{"nr":11,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Transparent information and communication","desc_en":"Often times companies are not really transparent about the rights of users. Article 11 makes it clear that companies have to give clear and transparent information to users."},
{"nr":12,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Procedures and mechanisms for exercising the rights of the data subject","desc_en":"Users have different rights when against a company. But how do you exercise such right? How long do you have to wait until a company sends you a copy of your data. Do you have to pay to get it? All those questions are answered in article 12."},
{"nr":13,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Rights in relation to recipients","desc_en":"Today data is often times shared with ohter companies. If your data turned out to be wrong or if it was deleted, does a company have to inform others about this? This is regulated by article 13."},
{"nr":14,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Information to the data subject","desc_en":"Rights to information are especially important, because users cannot look into the servers of a company and see what they are doing. So that users can decide if they want to use a service or not they have to get the necessary information. The exact amount of information is regulated by Article 14. Like with the information on food packages you can very much discuss how much information should be included."},
{"nr":15,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Right of access for the data subject","desc_en":"What information is a company actually holding about me? Through the right to access in article 15 everyone can find out what a company is storing about them. This is also an important basis to claim other rights. For example you first need to know what someone is storing about you before you can e.g. have false data corrected. Exceptions may allow companies to get sneak out of this obligation. On the other hand hundreds of access requests without any meaningful reason can be very bothersome for companies."},
{"nr":16,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Right to rectification","desc_en":"Data about people is not always correct. Most times this does not matter, but if you are e.g. not getting a contract because there is false credit information stored about you, this can be a problem. The right to rectification in article 16 allows you to have these mistakes corrected."},
{"nr":17,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Right to be forgotten and to erasure","desc_en":"You can never get rid of data traces. If someone has done something wrong, or if someone has published something problematic on the internet this could follow you around for your whole life. Therefore we have be deletion schemes in many cases (e.g. with criminal records). But when do companies have to delete old data? Do they have to ensure that stuff is removed from the internet, or is this simply an illusion? Article 17 is taking care of these questions and is highly disputed. "},
{"nr":18,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Right to data portability","desc_en":"Everyone that has tried to move his data from an old device to a new one knows that this can be difficult. The same problem can be seen online when you try to move your pictures, videos or other data from one service to another. The right to data portability in article 18 should resolve this problem, but is this even possible given the different systems in use?"},
{"nr":19,"name":"Rights of the Data Subject","topic":"Right to object","desc_en":"If a company is using users’ data without consent, the user should at least be able to object to such use. But in which cases and under which conditions? This is regulated by article 19."},
